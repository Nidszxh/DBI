B+Tree Data Structure for Efficient Database Indexing
B+ Tree Data Structure for Efficient Database Indexing
This library implements a widely used data structure in database systems to efficiently index and retrieve databases: the B+ Tree. It builds a Python-specific, modular implementation that is easy to understand, making it perfect as an exercise or even just for eventual development.

Features
Insertion: This feature adds new elements into the tree, preserving its balancing.
Search: Quickly locate elements with minimal I/O operations, ensuring fast data access.
Tree Structure: Implements leaf and non-leaf nodes, providing an efficient hierarchical layout.
How It Works
The B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure. It also maintains sorted data and allows search, sequential access, insert, and delete operations in logarithmic time. It is frequently used in database systems for indexing because it can store more than one key in the node and reduces the disk I/O.

Applications
Using it as an indexing mechanism to handle queries efficiently in a database.
Storage system that requires optimum retrieval of data
Example to introduce tree-based data structures in an academic environment
