# B+ Tree Data Structure for Efficient Database Indexing

This library implements a widely used data structure in database systems to efficiently index and retrieve databases: the **B+ Tree**. It provides a Python-specific, modular implementation that is easy to understand, making it perfect as a learning exercise or for further development.

## Features

- **Insertion**: Adds new elements into the tree, preserving its balanced structure.
- **Search**: Quickly locates elements with minimal I/O operations, ensuring fast data access.
- **Tree Structure**: Implements leaf and non-leaf nodes, providing an efficient hierarchical layout.

## How It Works

The B+ Tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows search, sequential access, insertion, and deletion operations in logarithmic time. It is frequently used in database systems for indexing due to its ability to store multiple keys in a single node, reducing disk I/O.

## Applications

- **Database Indexing**: Efficiently handles queries by serving as an indexing mechanism.
- **Storage Systems**: Optimizes data retrieval processes.
- **Educational Use**: Serves as a practical example for understanding tree-based data structures in academic settings.
